# AppEngine AI4SG Template

This template demos basic functionality of Google AppEngine and Google CloudSQL. Flask (and jinja2) and altair are also demoed for capturing user input as a request param for plotting. 

The datasource is based on Our World In Data's CO2 dataset which was uploaded to CloudSQL in a previous template.
